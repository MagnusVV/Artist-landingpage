                Zdzisław Beksiński was born in Sanok, southern Poland. He studied architecture at Kraków Polytechnic in 1947, finishing his studies in 1952. He returned to Sanok in 1955, working as a construction site supervisor, but found that he did not enjoy it. During this period, he had an interest in montage photography, sculpting, and painting. When he first started sculpting, he often used his construction site materials for his medium. His early photography was a precursor to his later paintings, often depicting peculiar wrinkles, desolate landscapes, and still-life faces on rough surfaces. His paintings often depict anxiety, such as torn doll faces, or faces erased or obscured by bandages wrapped around the portrait. His main focus was on abstract painting, although it seems his works in the 1960s were inspired by surrealism.

                As far as Polish art goes, Zdzisław Beksiński was a pioneer and a well-respected artist who sadly died too early. Beksiński was a modern-day surrealispainter,photographer and sculptor with a mind for the obscure. His paintings concocted up odd images in the mind, and were a true step into absurdity ithe field ofdystopian surrealism.

                Beksiński painted in a style that he called either a ‘baroque’ or ‘gothic’ format. He drew up images in the mind that represent a macabre surrealist outlookfrom a  dystopian world. His paintings depict blood, skeletons, horror, love, hell and many dark aspects of life and death. This led to an admiring fan base theworld over,  particularly those into gruesome art of a gory and imaginative nature beyond the realms of reality
