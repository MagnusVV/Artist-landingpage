            Zdzisław Beksiński was born in Sanok, southern Poland. He studied
            architecture at Kraków Polytechnic in 1947, finishing his studies in
            1952. He returned to Sanok in 1955, working as a construction site
            supervisor, but found that he did not enjoy it. During this period,
            he had an interest in montage photography, sculpting, and painting.
            When he first started sculpting, he often used his construction site
            materials for his medium. His early photography was a precursor to
            his later paintings, often depicting peculiar wrinkles, desolate
            landscapes, and still-life faces on rough surfaces. His paintings
            often depict anxiety, such as torn doll faces, or faces erased or
            obscured by bandages wrapped around the portrait. His main focus was
            on abstract painting, although it seems his works in the 1960s were
            inspired by surrealism.

            <p class="text-lg">
              <br />
              Polish painter, photographer, and sculptor, specializing in the
              field of dystopian surrealism. Beksiński made his paintings and
              drawings in what he called either a Baroque or a Gothic manner.
              <br />
              <br />
              His creations were made mainly in two periods. The first period of
              work is generally considered to contain expressionistic color,
              with a strong style of "utopian realism" and surreal architecture,
              like a doomsday scenario. The second period contained more
              abstract style, with the main features of formalism.
              <br />
              <br />
              Beksiński was stabbed to death at his Warsaw apartment in February
              2005, by a 19-year-old acquaintance from Wołomin, reportedly
              because he refused to lend him money.

            <p class="text-lg">
              Beksiński had no formal training as an artist. He was a graduate
              of the Faculty of Architecture at the Kraków Polytechnic,
              receiving an MSc in 1952. His paintings were mainly created using
              oil paint on hardboard panels that he personally prepared,
              although he also experimented with acrylic paints. Beksinski
              listened to classical music while painting.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#45292A]">Fantastic Realism</h3>
            <br />
            <p class="text-lg">
              An exhibition of Beksiński's works organized by Janusz Bogucki in
              Warsaw in 1964 was his first major success.<br />
              Beksiński undertook painting with a passion, working intensely
              while listening to classical music. He soon became the leading
              figure in contemporary Polish art. In the late 1960s, Beksiński
              entered what he himself called his "fantastic period," which
              lasted into the mid-1980s. This is his best-known period, during
              which he created disturbing images, showing a gloomy, surrealistic
              environment with detailed scenes of death, decay, landscapes
              filled with skeletons, deformed figures, and deserts. These
              detailed works were painted with his trademark precision. At the
              time, Beksiński claimed, "I wish to paint in such a manner as if I
              were photographing dreams."<br />
              Despite the grim overtones, Beksiński claimed some of his works
              were misunderstood; in his opinion, they were rather optimistic or
              even humorous. For the most part, Beksiński was adamant that even
              he did not know the meaning of his artworks and was uninterested
              in possible interpretations; in keeping with this notion, he
              refused to provide titles for any of his drawings or paintings.
              Before moving to Warsaw in 1977, he destroyed a selection of his
              works in his own backyard, without leaving any documentation
              concerning them.<br />
              According to Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro "In the
              medieval tradition, Beksinski seems to believe art to be a
              forewarning about the fragility of the flesh––whatever pleasures
              we know are doomed to perish––thus, his paintings manage to evoke
              at once the process of decay and the ongoing struggle for life.
              They hold within them a secret poetry, stained with blood and
              rust."
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#45292A]">Later work</h3>
            <br />
            <p class="text-lg">
              The 1980s marked a transitory period for Beksiński. During this
              time, his works became more popular in France due to the endeavors
              of Piotr Dmochowski, and Beksiński achieved significant popularity
              in Western Europe, the United States, and Japan. His art, in the
              late 1980s and early 1990s, focused on monumental or
              sculpture-like images rendered in a restricted and often subdued
              colour palette, including a series of crosses. Paintings in this
              style, which often appear to have been sketched densely in
              coloured lines, were much less lavish than those of his "fantastic
              period" but just as powerful. In 1994, Beksiński explained, "I'm
              going in the direction of a greater simplification of the
              background, and at the same time a considerable degree of
              deformation in the figures, which are being painted without what's
              known as naturalistic light and shadow. What I'm after is for it
              to be obvious at first sight that this is a painting I made".<br />
              In the later part of the 1990s, he became interested in computers,
              the Internet, digital photography and photo manipulation, a medium
              that he focused on until his death.

            As far as Polish art goes, Zdzisław Beksiński was a pioneer and a
            well-respected artist who sadly died too early. Beksiński was a
            modern-day surrealispainter,photographer and sculptor with a mind
            for the obscure. His paintings concocted up odd images in the mind,
            and were a true step into absurdity ithe field ofdystopian
            surrealism.

          <p id="info-text" class="mb-4">
            Beksiński painted in a style that he called either a ‘baroque’ or
            ‘gothic’ format. He drew up images in the mind that represent a
            macabre surrealist outlookfrom a dystopian world. His paintings
            depict blood, skeletons, horror, love, hell and many dark aspects of
            life and death. This led to an admiring fan base theworld over,

              The Cursed Paintings of Zdzisław Beksiński
            </h3>

            <p class="text-lg">
              Author: Culture.pl<br />
              Published: Jul 10 2015<br />
              <br />
              A decade after his brutal murder, Zdzisław Beksiński’s paintings
              hold the world spellbound. Is the universal fascination they evoke
              the result of their author’s own gruesome tragedies, or did
              Beksiński simply succeed at capturing the unsettling underside of
              human consciousness?<br />
              <br />
              During his long career, Zdzisław Beksiński worked in many fields
              of art: sculpture, photography, graphic art, drawing, and last but
              not least, painting. All of Beksiński’s paintings are untitled –
              he wanted to avoid any metaphorical interpretation of his
              paintings. As an artist, Beksiński was fascinated with death,
              decay and darkness. But those weren’t his only fascinations. He
              was also known for his interest in eroticism, abstractionism and
              Eastern mysticism. From the mid-1960s onwards, he was very popular
              in Poland. In the 1980s and 1990s, Beksiński’s paintings were
              exhibited abroad, including France and Japan, and he became an
              internationally recognised artist. His style is sometimes compared
              to that of Hans Giger, the Swiss painter who designed the
              extra-terrestrial creatures for the famous 1979 film Alien.
              <br />
              <br />
              Beksiński was one of the few artists who, at the beginning of the
              sixties, consciously abandoned the avant-garde heritage to search
              for a synthesis of various styles.<br />
