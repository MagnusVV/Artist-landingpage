# Artist-landingpage

## About
The final project for the course in Digital Design. A collaborative effort with another student, the task was to create a Figma prototype and then a responsive landing-webpage from that prototype. This was the first time we tried our hands on Tailwind CSS, and it was quite the challenge. :)

### Participants
MagnusVV, styrbjorn-n

We choose the polish painter Zdzisław Beksiński as subject, and the page contains some facts about him as well as some examples of his works. Due to time constraints we worked from two different directions: I built the desktop version and down, and styrbjorn-n build the mobile version and up. The finished product has got some limited interactivity, but the task was mostly to create something as similar as the prototype as possible, and in that we succeeded.

There wasn't a task condition for it to be deployed, so we didn't. We didn't quite found the time for it.

To have a look at it, download the repository. From the root browse to code -> src -> index.html and use Live Server (or similar) to open a local server.
